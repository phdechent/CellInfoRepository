This study benchmarks eight different (five 21700 and three 18650 format) high-energy cylindrical cells concerning their suitability for automotive applications and aims to give a holistic overview and comparison between them. Therefore, an ante-mortem material analysis, a benchmark of electrical and thermal values as well as a cycle life study were carried out.

After opening the cells under argon atmosphere, the battery materials are extracted to conduct various chemical and physical measurements to define the active material type, microstructure, conductivity and mass loading of the electrodes. Furthermore, laboratory cells were built from the extracted materials to evaluate tortuosity and exchange current density by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, open circuit voltages and solid diffusion coefficient by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). The differences and similarities of these parameters for both cell types are discussed and compared to literature. Main differences are the electrode area, thickness, porosity, and thus, mass loading and areal capacity of the electrodes. Both cells have a NCA cathode, but only the high energy cell has a blend anode consisting of graphite and Si/SiO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> whereas the anode active material of the high power cell is only made of graphite.

Depending on the manufacturer, three different cell formats are used in the automotive sector (pouch, prismatic, and cylindrical). In the last 3 years, cylindrical cells have gained strong relevance and popularity among automotive manufacturers, mainly driven by innovative cell designs, such as the Tesla tabless design. This paper investigates 19 Li-ion cylindrical battery cells from four cell manufacturers in four formats (18650, 20700, 21700, and 4680). We aim to systematically capture the design features, such as tab design and quality parameters, such as manufacturing tolerances and generically describe cylindrical cells. We identified the basic designs and assigned example cells to them. In addition, we show a comprehensive definition of a tabless design considering the current and heat transport paths. Our findings show that the Tesla 4680 design is quasi-tabless. In addition, we found that 25% of the cathode and 30% of the anode are not notched, resulting in long electrical and thermal transport paths. Based on CT and post-mortem analyses, we show that jelly rolls can be approximated very well with the Archimedean spiral. Furthermore, we compare the gravimetric and volumetric energy density, the impedance, and the heating behavior at the surface and in the center of the jelly rolls. From the generic description, we present and discuss production processes focusing on format and design flexible manufacturing of jelly rolls.</jats:p>",

The aging step is a time-consuming and cost-intensive process due to relaxation effects disturbing the self-discharge measuremtens. Relaxation effects are mainly attributed to voltage relaxation and anode overhang equalization. In this work, different methods for electrical self-discharge measurement, such as the voltage decay method, the voltage hold method, and the capacity loss method, were investigated using commercial Samsung INR21700\u201350E cylindrical cells (NCA/silicon-graphite) and non-commercial pouch-cells (NMC622/graphite). Various preconditioning methods allowed a distinction to be made between undisturbed, short-term, and long-term disturbed cells. While short-term disturbances subsided after several hours, long-term disturbances due to anode overhang were found to significantly disturb all electrical self-discharge measurements for several weeks. A theoretical explanation was introduced, describing the lithium inventory change due to anode and coupled side reactions being measured differently by voltage- and capacity-based methods. Experimental results confirmed this notion and showed that voltage-based self-discharge measurements underestimated the anode overhang equalization. A comparison to the initial cell aging data indicated that the self-discharge measurement performed shortly after cell formation was disturbed by the anode overhang equalization.</jats:p>",

The deployment of a Battery Management System (BMS) unit is the key point to oversee the battery state of the electric vehicle (EV) to ensure safety and performances. The development and assessment of electric vehicle models in turn lays the groundwork of the BMS design as it provides a quick and cheap solution to test battery optimal control logics in a Software-in-the-Loop environment. Despite the various contribution to the literature in battery and vehicle modeling, electric scooters are mostly disregarded together with a reliable estimation of their performance and electric range. The present paper hence aims at filling the gap of knowledge through the development of a numerical model for considering a two-wheeler. The latter model relies on the conservation energy based-longitudinal dynamic approach and is coupled to a Li-Ion Battery second-order RC equivalent circuit model for the electric range prediction. More specifically, the presented work assesses the performance and electric range of a two-wheeler pure electric scooter in a real-world driving cycle. The e-powertrain system embeds an Electrical Energy Storage System (EESS) Li-Ion Battery pack. On-road tests were initially conducted to retrieve the main model parameters and to perform its validation. A global battery-to-wheels efficiency was also calibrated to account for the percentual amount of available net power for the vehicle onset. The model proved to properly match the experimental data in terms of total distance traveled over a validation driving mission.</jats:p>",

Since some of the commercial dielectric liquids used as refrigeration liquids contain halogens, their presence will contribute to a formation of hazardous emissions such as hydrofluoric acid during a potential fire. In this study, a simulation of a high temperature accident has been performed for lithium-ion batteries cooled with the direct immersion cooling systems using single-phase dielectric liquids to define their contribution to HF formation. Four commercial refrigeration liquids based on perfluoropolyethers, hydrofluoroether and polyalphaolefin were investigated in this work. By simulation of a fire, it was observed that the refrigeration liquids delayed the smoke formation by a factor of 2 to 2.5 in comparison to the case when the battery was burned without the cooling liquid. By analysis of the fluoride concentration in the washing system, it was determined that without the refrigeration liquid approximately 46.8\u00a0mmol/l of [F] was captured after the fire. When refrigeration liquids based on two perfluoropolyethers and hydrofluoroether were applied, the fluoride concentration in the washing system was 259\u00a0mmol/l, 173\u00a0mmol/l and 145\u00a0mmol/l, respectively. This work also proposed the reaction mechanisms of the refrigeration liquid\u00b4s decomposition during a fire. It was concluded that the refrigeration liquid based on polyalphaolefin does not contribute to the additional formation of hydrofluoric acid due to the chemical stability and low content of fluoride and can be considered as a more sustainable alternative for a direct cooling system for Lithium-ion batteries. \n</jats:p>",

As this requires regularization due to the ill-conditioned optimization problem, the investigation of data-driven methods becomes of interest. One promising approach is the Loewner method (LM), which has already had a number of applications in different fields of science but has not been applied to batteries yet. In this work, it is first deployed on synthetic data with predefined time constants and gains. The results are analyzed concerning the choice of model order, the type of processes , i.e., distributed and discrete, and the signal-to-noise ratio. Afterwards, the LM is used to identify and analyze the processes of a cylindrical LIB. To verify the results of this assessment a comparison is made with the generalized DRT at two different states of health of the LIB. It is shown that both methods lead to the same qualitative results. For the assignment of processes as well as for the interpretation of minor gains, the LM shows advantageous behavior, whereas the generalized DRT shows better results for the determination of lumped elements and resistive\u2013inductive processes.</jats:p>",
