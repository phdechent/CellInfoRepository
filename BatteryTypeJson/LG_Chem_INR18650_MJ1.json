Parameters as terminal voltage, operating current, power losses and efficiency are determined depending on battery state of charge (SOC) and operating power. For electrochemical transient modelling, an equivalent RC-circuit is included based on Thevenin battery model. It is assumed in the model that internal resistance, open circuit voltage and the RC-circuit voltage drop depends only on the SOC. Experimental data was obtained from the LG INR18650 MJ1 battery discharge curves. Modelling was performed for SOC values in the range of 0.17 to 0.95 since the terminal voltage dependence on SOC is nearly linear there.

A total of 10% of the drivers was categorised as aggressive, with an even distribution between the genders. For the gentle drivers, 11% of the drivers, the men dominated. The driving style investigation was extended to utilise machine learning, confirming the results from statistical tools. As driving style highly impacts a vehicle\u2019s fuel consumption, while switching over to battery electric vehicles it is important to investigate how the different driving styles impact battery utilisation. Two Li-ion battery cell types were tested utilising the same load cycle with three levels of current amplitude, to represent accelerations for the three drive categories. While one cell type was insensitive to the current amplitude, the highly energy-optimised cell proved to be sensitive to higher current amplitudes, corresponding to a more aggressive driving style. Thus, the amplitude of the dynamic current can for some cells be a factor that needs to be considered for lifetime predictions, while it can be neglected for other cells.</jats:p>",

This study analyses the factors that affect the charge behavior for 18,650 commercial nickel-rich/silicon-graphite batteries. For that, long-term cycling tests have been carried out, including electric vehicle standard tests. It can be concluded that this technology has two key issues to develop an efficient charge method: high charge rates should be avoided, mainly below 15% state of charge, and the charge should be finished at 95% of actual cell capacity. This allows that, regardless of application and cell degradation level, cells can be recharged in 2 h without a negative impact on cycling life. For faster charge applications, a new method has been developed to minimize charging time without compromising the cycle life as much as the high current manufacturer method. The proposed fast charge method has proven to be notably faster, recharging in an average 1.3 h (48% less than the high current method and 68% less than the standard method).</jats:p>",

The theoretical framework assumes a shrinking core mechanism, where lattice oxygen, [O], release occurs at the interface between the bulk and the passivation layer, and the rate of reaction is controlled by either [O]-diffusion through the passivation layer or the reaction kinetics at the interface. As the passivation layer grows, the core of active positive electrode material shrinks giving rise to both loss in active material (LAM) and loss in lithium inventory (LLI) through trapping lithium in the passivation layer, giving rise to capacity fade. The slower diffusion of lithium through the passivation layer also gives rise to power fade.

Assessing possible additional aging due to switching, the results of a previous study for a high-power optimized cell showed no influence on the current rates or the switching. In this paper, a highly energy-optimized LG 18650-cell is investigated to discuss the influence of switching during the charge and discharge process, respectively, as well as combining both processes together with clear performance differences when applying higher charge and discharge currents. Moreover, the influence of switching is discussed for the two frequencies (50 Hz and 10 kHz) and different duty cycles. The aging is analyzed by capacity loss and resistance increase, by dV/dQ analysis, and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We found no clear negative influence of switching but a positive effect if the cells are switched during charge. The best performance is found for switching during charge as well as during discharge. The cell aging during switching is clearly determined by the average and not the maximum current applied. This work shows no negative effects of multilevel inverter applications on the tested cells.</jats:p>",

The predominant deformation pattern during galvanostatic discharge process is an isotropic cylindrical shrinkage relevant to the extraction of lithium ions from the graphite negative electrode. In the case of low-rate discharge in cyclic voltammetry mode, the deformation pattern changes to spherical growth when the state of charge falls below 40. In contrast, the thermal shrinkage and growth of the cell corresponds to simple decrease of the cell diameter with much smaller hysteresis effect. The ultrasound interrogation is able to detect repeatable progressive change of the acoustic waveform transferred across the cell in direction of the jellyroll diameter, which depends on the state of charge and does not undergo any significant changes at different cycling rates.

The short-circuit experiments showed that the MJ1 technology is protected against this type of thermal abuse by the current interruption device (CID) integrated in the positive terminal of the cell. The results indicate that the strain gage signal is able to provide very rapid alert for this type of battery safety breach due to an abrupt change of the cell pressure. It precedes the time of the increase of the skin temperature by an order of magnitude. The thermal stability experiments carried out in adiabatic rate calorimeter on completely charged and overcharged batteries at open circuit conditions, showed that the MJ1 technology is susceptible to self-heating by slow internal exothermic reactions starting above 60 \u00b0C. The subsequent process of thermal runaway starts when the temperature exceeds 140 C. The results from the extended monitoring of the cells during the thermal stability tests showed that the acoustic ultrasound interrogation data combined with data mapping and clustering of the signal provides advantageous indication for early detection of slowly approaching battery safety breach events.</jats:p>",

The extent to which each of the contributors and the interaction between them affects the current distribution within the battery module is crucial to improve the system\u2019s efficiency, which is investigated here via various electrically cross-linked, physicochemical-thermal simulations with variable system terminal (ST). Consequently, cross-connectors balance the system and reduce DoD shifts between cells. Furthermore, if one compares ST-side and ST-cross, the position of the ST is negligible for topologies that incorporate at least two cells in serial and parallel. Depending on the ST configuration, point and axis symmetry patterns appear for the current distribution. Compared to welding seam and cross-connector resistances, the string connector resistance dominates the current distribution. Like the behavior of a single cell, the system\u2019s rate capability shows a non-linear decrease with increasing C-rate under constant current discharge. As a recommendation for the assembly of battery modules using multiple lithium-ion cells, the position of the ST is of minor importance compared to the presence of cross-connectors and low-resistance string connectors.</jats:p>",

In order to be relevant in practical applications, EIS analysis needs to be carried out with low-cost sensors, which suffer from high levels of measurement noise. This article presents an approach to estimate the equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameters of a Li-Ion battery pack based on EIS measurements in the presence of high levels of noise. The proposed algorithm consists of a fast Fourier transform, feature extraction, curve fitting, and least-squares estimation. The results of the proposed parameter-estimation algorithm are compared to that of recent work for objective performance comparison. The error analysis of the proposed approach, in comparison to the existing approach, demonstrated significant improvement in parameter estimation accuracy in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the previous method under high-measurement-noise scenarios without requiring a significant increase in computational resources.</jats:p>",

Depending on the manufacturer, three different cell formats are used in the automotive sector (pouch, prismatic, and cylindrical). In the last 3 years, cylindrical cells have gained strong relevance and popularity among automotive manufacturers, mainly driven by innovative cell designs, such as the Tesla tabless design. This paper investigates 19 Li-ion cylindrical battery cells from four cell manufacturers in four formats (18650, 20700, 21700, and 4680). We aim to systematically capture the design features, such as tab design and quality parameters, such as manufacturing tolerances and generically describe cylindrical cells. We identified the basic designs and assigned example cells to them. In addition, we show a comprehensive definition of a tabless design considering the current and heat transport paths. Our findings show that the Tesla 4680 design is quasi-tabless. In addition, we found that 25% of the cathode and 30% of the anode are not notched, resulting in long electrical and thermal transport paths. Based on CT and post-mortem analyses, we show that jelly rolls can be approximated very well with the Archimedean spiral. Furthermore, we compare the gravimetric and volumetric energy density, the impedance, and the heating behavior at the surface and in the center of the jelly rolls. From the generic description, we present and discuss production processes focusing on format and design flexible manufacturing of jelly rolls.</jats:p>",

Moreover, present studies are unable to exclude the impacts of measurement systems on their final results. To counter this deficiency, a novel 4-wire measurement technique is used which does not influence the current distribution but allows both single and parallel measurements to be recorded without changing the measurement configuration. Cells in parallel generally displayed improved aging behaviors in comparison to those seen in the single-cell aging study and the positive influence of extended CV-charging was evident, as long as the CV-charging phase was limited in length. It was also observed that the exclusion of critical voltage ranges exerted the most significant influence on the aging rate and dominates the influence of initial cell-to-cell variations in the long-term. As a result, it is recommended that module manufacturers reduce the effort spent on initial cell matching strategies for cells in parallel in favor of developing cell-specific charging profiles.</jats:p>",

In particular, silicon-graphite anodes show increased aging effects due to the extensive volume expansion of silicon and even small variations of its content lead to significant changes in the cell properties because of its large specific capacity. Two batches of the same cell, which differ slightly in their silicon content, were investigated using various charging profiles for a temperature range from 0 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C. The total number of EFC of both cell batches was shown to be strongly dependent on temperature. In addition, cells with reduced silicon content showed EFCs three times higher than their higher silicon counterparts. Contrary to expectations, an extended CV-charging sequence led to an increase in EFC and a decrease in variance. The exclusion of critical voltage ranges shows the most significant influence on both the total of EFC and the variance between the cells. As a result, to increase cell lifetime it is recommended that cells should be preconditioned at low ambient temperatures and extended CV-charging sequences should be considered.
