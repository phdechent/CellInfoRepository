In obtaining these states, the capacity of the battery is an indispensable parameter that is hard to detect directly online. However, there is a strong correlation relationship between this parameter and battery internal resistance. This article first shows a simple and effective online internal resistance detection method. Secondly, the relationship between the measured internal resistance and the LiBs capacity is established by linear fitting. Finally, the capacity through internal resistance conversion is applied in SOC estimation. The estimation results show that this method can effectively enhance the SOC estimation accuracy regardless of temperature change and battery degradation.</jats:p>",

The BMS realizes the goal of monitoring the voltage, current, and ambient temperature of lithium batteries, estimating the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH), protecting the battery from abuse during charging or discharging, and ensuring the consistency of the batteries by integrating the passive equalization circuit. The BMS was proven effective and feasible through several tests, including charging/discharging, estimation accuracy, and communication tests. The results indicated that the BMS could be used in the design and application of the electric bicycle.</jats:p>",

Its performance, especially in terms of state of charge (SOC), plays a significant role in the energy management of these vehicles. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is widely used to estimate online SOC as an efficient estimation algorithm. However, conventional EKF algorithms cannot accurately estimate the difference between individual batteries, which should not be ignored. However, the internal resistance of a battery can represent this difference. Therefore, this work proposes using an EKF with internal resistance measurement based on the conventional algorithm. Lithium-ion battery real-time resistances can help the Kalman filter overcome defects from simplistic battery models. In addition, experimental results show that it is useful to introduce online internal resistance to the estimation of SOC.</jats:p>",

To provide a safe system, specialized high voltage (HV) electromechanical switches are used to perform these major functions such as switch on, switch off or pre-charging. Due to these components can be easily damaged, expensive, heavy and bulky, a solution based on pure semiconductors may be desired to accomplish these operations. Many studies were exhibited on EV battery systems regarding developing solid-state systems for HV switchgear. Developing technology on semiconductor devices allows to make a safety concept based on only solidstate components. This study presents a comprehensive analysis off pre-charge sequences between conventional and semiconductor switchgear to be used in electric vehicle battery systems.

If the high rate of gas generation during thermal runaway is not adequately vented, commercial cell designs can rupture and explode, presenting serious safety concerns. Here, ultra\u2010high\u2010speed synchrotron X\u2010ray imaging is used at &gt;20 000 frames per second to characterize the venting processes of six different 18650 cell designs undergoing thermal runaway. For the first time, the mechanisms that lead to the most catastrophic type of cell failure, rupture, and explosion are identified and elucidated in detail. The practical application of the technique is highlighted by evaluating a novel 18650 cell design with a second vent at the base, which is shown to avoid the critical stages that lead to rupture. The insights yielded in this study shed new light on battery failure and are expected to guide the development of safer commercial cell designs.</jats:p>",

In order to make EVs more competitive with combustion engine vehicles, development of an effective fast charging technique is inevitable. However, improper employment of fast charging can damage the battery and bring safety hazards. Herein, industry based along with our proposed internal resistance (IR) based fast charging techniques were performed on commercial Panasonic NCR 18650B cylindrical batteries. To further investigate the fast charging impact and electrode degradation mechanisms, electrochemical analysis and material characterization techniques including EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy), GITT (galvanostatic intermittent titration technique), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), and XRD (X\u2010ray diffraction) were implemented. Batteries that were cycled under industry based fast charging showed 78% increase in internal resistance after 120\u2009cycles along with rapid capacity fading. Mechanical distortion of the battery case occurred around the 60th cycle for industry based fast charging. In contrast, IR based fast charged batteries showed 29.4% increase in internal resistance over 120\u2009cycles. In addition, mechanical distortion was not observed and the relative capacity fading was on a moderate level. Furthermore, this work could pave the way for the optimization of fast charging techniques to secure the lifespan and safety of various types of lithium\u2010ion batteries.</jats:p>",

In particular, systems based on lithium-ion batteries have evolved rapidly with a wide range of cell technologies and system architectures available on the market. On the application side, different tasks for storage deployment demand distinct properties of the storage system. This review aims to serve as a guideline for best choice of battery technology, system design and operation for lithium-ion based storage systems to match a specific system application. Starting with an overview to lithium-ion battery technologies and their characteristics with respect to performance and aging, the storage system design is analyzed in detail based on an evaluation of real-world projects. Typical storage system applications are grouped and classified with respect to the challenges posed to the battery system. Publicly available modeling tools for technical and economic analysis are presented. A brief analysis of optimization approaches aims to point out challenges and potential solution techniques for system sizing, positioning and dispatch operation. For all areas reviewed herein, expected improvements and possible future developments are highlighted. In order to extract the full potential of stationary battery storage systems and to enable increased profitability of systems, future research should aim to a holistic system level approach combining not only performance tuning on a battery cell level and careful analysis of the application requirements, but also consider a proper selection of storage sub-components as well as an optimized system operation strategy.</jats:p>",
