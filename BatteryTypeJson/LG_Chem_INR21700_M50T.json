These power subsystems can generate undesired electrical harmonics on the direct current (DC) bus of the powertrain. This may lead to the on-board battery being subjected to DC current superposed with undesirable high- and low- frequency current oscillations, known as ripples. From real-world measurements, significant current harmonics perturbations within the range of 50 Hz to 4 kHz have been observed on the high voltage DC bus of the EV. In the limited literature, investigations into the impact of these harmonics on the degradation of battery systems have been conducted. In these studies, the battery systems were supplied by superposed current signals i.e., DC superposed by a single frequency alternating current (AC). None of these studies considered applying the entire spectrum of the ripple current measured in the real-world scenario, which is focused on in this research. The preliminary results indicate that there is no difference concerning capacity fade or impedance rise between the cells subjected to just DC current and those subjected additionally to a superposed AC ripple current.</jats:p>",

This study benchmarks eight different (five 21700 and three 18650 format) high-energy cylindrical cells concerning their suitability for automotive applications and aims to give a holistic overview and comparison between them. Therefore, an ante-mortem material analysis, a benchmark of electrical and thermal values as well as a cycle life study were carried out. The results show that even when applying similar concepts like Nickel-rich cathodes with graphite-based anodes, the cells show wide variations in their performance under the same test conditions.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, the whole workflow, from the cell characterization tests to the cell parameter identification and finally validation studies, is examined on a cylindrical 5 Ah LG217000 Lithium-Ion-Battery (LIB) with a nickel manganese cobalt chemistry. Additionally, different test procedures are compared with respect to their result quality. For the parameter identification, a Matlab tool is developed enabling the user to generate all necessary ECMs in one run. The accuracy of the developed ECMs is evaluated by comparing voltage prediction of the experimental and simulation results for the highly dynamic World harmonized Light vehicle Test Cycle (WLTC) at different states of charges (SOCs) and ambient temperatures. The results show that parameter dependencies such as hysteresis and current are neglectable, if only the voltage results are compared. Considering the heat generation prediction, however, the neglection can result in mispredictions of up to 9% (current) or 22% (hysteresis) and hence should not be neglected. Concluding the voltage and heat generation results, this study recommends using a Dual Polarization (DP) or Thevenin ECM considering all parameter dependencies except for the charge/discharge current dependency for thermal modeling of LIBs.</jats:p>",

Moreover, lab\u2010made full\u2010cells are exploited to verify the reproducibility when compared with cylindrical cells. The results of an extensive analysis of around 500 EIS spectra return an unambiguous attribution of different electrochemical processes to different time constants and ultimately to different DRT peaks. Digital imaging validates graphite degradation, mainly related to lithium plating. Scanning electron microscopy validates the degradation at NMC cathode, mainly attributed to particle cracking. It is concluded that DRT peaks allow to characterize cell aging and their tracking can help to develop more reliable state of health estimators.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This work introduces a methodology to track Li-ion cells degradation and estimate SoH based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Distribution of relaxation times (DRT) were exploited to derive indicators linked to the so-called degradation modes (DMs), which group the different aging mechanisms. The combination of these indicators was used to model the aging progression over the whole lifetime (both in the \u201cpre-knee\u201d and \u201cafter-knee\u201d regions), enabling a physics-based SoH estimation. The methodology was applied to commercial cylindrical cells (NMC811|Graphite SiOx). The results showed that loss of lithium inventory (LLI) is the main driving factor for cell degradation, followed by loss of cathode active material (LAMC). SoH estimation was achievable with a mean absolute error lower than 0.75% for SoH values higher than 85% and lower than 3.70% SoH values between 85% and 80% (end of life). The analyses of the results will allow for guidelines to be defined to replicate the presented methodology, characterize new Li-ion cell types, and perform onboard SoH estimation in battery management system (BMS) solutions.</jats:p>",

Depending on the manufacturer, three different cell formats are used in the automotive sector (pouch, prismatic, and cylindrical). In the last 3 years, cylindrical cells have gained strong relevance and popularity among automotive manufacturers, mainly driven by innovative cell designs, such as the Tesla tabless design. This paper investigates 19 Li-ion cylindrical battery cells from four cell manufacturers in four formats (18650, 20700, 21700, and 4680). We aim to systematically capture the design features, such as tab design and quality parameters, such as manufacturing tolerances and generically describe cylindrical cells. We identified the basic designs and assigned example cells to them. In addition, we show a comprehensive definition of a tabless design considering the current and heat transport paths. Our findings show that the Tesla 4680 design is quasi-tabless. In addition, we found that 25% of the cathode and 30% of the anode are not notched, resulting in long electrical and thermal transport paths. Based on CT and post-mortem analyses, we show that jelly rolls can be approximated very well with the Archimedean spiral. Furthermore, we compare the gravimetric and volumetric energy density, the impedance, and the heating behavior at the surface and in the center of the jelly rolls. From the generic description, we present and discuss production processes focusing on format and design flexible manufacturing of jelly rolls.</jats:p>",
